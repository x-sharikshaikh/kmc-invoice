KMC Invoice App — QA Checklist

Goal: Verify core invoice generation, pagination, formatting, printing, and packaged EXE behavior.

Prereqs
- Windows 11 test machine (one dev machine, one clean machine for EXE test)
- Python environment with project dependencies installed (for dev run)
- Optional: default PDF viewer installed (Edge/Adobe)

A. Basic run
1) Launch app (dev):
   - PowerShell:
     python app/main.py
   - App opens without errors; invoice number prefilled.

B. Pagination scenarios
For each scenario: fill Bill To (name/phone/address), set date (dd-MM-yyyy), add rows in table, then Save PDF and visually inspect.

1) Single-row invoice (1 row)
   - Add 1 item with description ~20–40 chars.
   - Verify:
     - Page count = 1 (A4 portrait)
     - Date format dd-MM-yyyy
     - Qty right aligned (up to 3 decimals, no trailing zeros)
     - Rate/Amount with exactly 2 decimals
  - Total equals sum of amounts (no tax)
     - Thank-you line present
     - Footer shows Permit/PAN/Cheque to (if set)
     - Signature rectangle on bottom-right
     - Logo visible if configured (assets/logo.png or settings.logo_path)

2) Mid-size invoice (6 rows)
   - Add 6 items; ensure at least one long description (~100–140 chars).
   - Verify:
     - All rows on a single page (header + table header + rows + totals fit)
     - Description wraps to max 2 lines per row with ellipsis if needed
     - Numeric columns share a right edge and align across different row heights
     - Grid lines light, header rule and totals rules slightly bolder

3) Long invoice (15 rows)
   - Add 15 items (mix of short/long descriptions).
   - Verify:
     - Pagination occurs (2+ pages)
     - Repeated header and table header on each new page
     - No totals on intermediate pages; totals only on final page
     - No overlap between last row and footer/signature area
     - Thank-you line above signature area on final page

C. Content & formatting checks
- Header: "INVOICE" title bold; logo positioned left; header rule visible
- Columns: Sl., Description, Qty, Rate, Amount headers present
- Numbers:
  - Qty formatted up to 3 decimals without trailing zeros
  - Rate/Amount/Total displayed with 2 decimals
  - Totals computed with rounding to 2 decimals (banker’s rounding)
- Footer: Permit, PAN, Cheque to present when configured
- Colors: white background, black text, gray table grid, black header/totals/signature rules

D. Printing
- Open a generated PDF from ~/Documents/KMC Invoices
- Print to:
  1) Physical printer (if available) — verify layout/contrast
  2) Microsoft Print to PDF — file saved, content intact
- From the app, use Print button and confirm behavior

E. Packaged EXE (clean Windows 11)
1) Build on dev machine:
   - Ensure deps: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Build:
     pyinstaller --noconfirm --clean --name "KMC Invoice" --noconsole --hidden-import sqlalchemy --hidden-import pydantic --add-data "assets;assets" --add-data "settings.json;." app/main.py
   - Or:
     pyinstaller tools/build.spec
2) Copy dist/KMC Invoice/ to a clean Windows 11 machine
3) First run:
   - Launch KMC Invoice.exe; settings.json should appear beside EXE if missing
   - Add 3–5 items, Save PDF, open/print
   - Verify logo/fonts load if assets folder is present
4) Repeat pagination checks (6/15 rows) quickly to spot regressions

F. Report findings
- Record any issues, screenshots, and PDF samples
- Update README “Notes” or a dedicated section with resolved items or known issues
- File bugs with reproduction steps and attach sample PDFs where helpful
